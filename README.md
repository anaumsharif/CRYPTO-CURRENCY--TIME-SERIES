# CRYPTO-CURRENCY--TIME-SERIES

Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time.
Using machine learning for cryptocurrency price prediction can only work in situations where prices change due to historical prices that people see before buying and selling their cryptocurrency.
In time series analysis, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly
The prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies donâ€™t just depend on the number of people who buy or sell them.
Today, the change in the prices of these investments also depends on the changes in the financial policies of the government regarding any cryptocurrency. 
The feelings of people towards a particular cryptocurrency or personality who directly or indirectly endorse a cryptocurrency also result in a huge buying and selling of a particular cryptocurrency, resulting in a change in prices.
